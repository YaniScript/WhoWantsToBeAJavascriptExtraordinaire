# WhoWantsToBeAJavascriptExtraordinaire

My quiz is on its way but its not ready just yet.
I have some more figuring out to do to get the functionality where I want it but I'm excited to revisit this and make it better.

This quiz is based on the game show "Who wants to be a millionaire" hence the name "Who wants to be a Javascript Extraordinaire?"

I have some pretty cool questions planned to but what you will find in the code, specifically the script.js is the placeholder for
the questions.

The outline/foundation of the code is in the index.html, the styles are in the style.css file, and the script.js holds the questions
with more functionality to come.
